The primary focus is on optimizing the city's bus network, a vital component of urban infrastructure that directly impacts the daily lives of residents. Despite the crucial role it plays, public transportation systems often face challenges that can lead to inefficiencies, such as suboptimal routing, scheduling issues, and uneven service distribution. By utilizing a dataset encompassing various aspects of France's public transportation network, this project aims to explore and address these challenges.
