# Public Transportation Optimization through Clustering in France

## Introduction
In this project, we embarked on an analytical journey to enhance the efficiency and reliability of a public transportation system. The primary objective was to identify patterns and inefficiencies within the system, focusing on aspects such as train delays, travel times, and the punctuality of arrivals and departures. By leveraging the KMeans clustering technique, our goal was to categorize different segments of the transportation service, aiming to pinpoint specific areas that could benefit from targeted improvements.

Through a detailed data-driven approach, employing methods like the elbow method for optimal cluster determination and meticulous data normalization, we sought to uncover underlying trends and clusters within the transportation data. This project not only aimed to provide actionable insights for transportation optimization but also served as a testament to the transformative power of data analysis in operational management.
## About the Data
The dataset utilized in this project was sourced from Kaggle, specifically the "[Public Transport Traffic Data in France](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gatandubuc/public-transport-traffic-data-in-france)" dataset . This dataset provides a comprehensive view of the public transportation system in France, encompassing a wide array of metrics that reflect the operational dynamics of train services.

#### Dataset Overview
The dataset is rich in both breadth and depth, offering a detailed snapshot of various aspects of public transportation. Key features include:
- **Number of Late Trains (> 15min)**: This measures the count of trains experiencing significant delays.
- **Average Delay of Late Departing Trains (min)**: A metric capturing the average delay encountered by trains that departed later than scheduled.
- **Number of Trains Late on Arrival**: The total number of trains that arrived at their destination behind schedule.
- **Average Travel Time (min)**: Reflects the mean travel duration for the trains within the dataset.

These features were pivotal in our analysis, enabling us to dissect the performance of the train services across different dimensions.

#### Dataset Size and Statistics
The dataset comprises a substantial number of records, offering a robust foundation for our analysis. The size and diversity of the data ensured that our findings and insights were grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the transportation system's dynamics.

#### Data Preprocessing and Exploration
Initial steps in our project included cleaning and preprocessing the data. We handled missing values, standardized the features for uniformity, and conducted exploratory data analysis to gain preliminary insights. This phase was crucial in shaping our approach to clustering and further analysis.

#### Visualizations
Throughout the project, various visualizations were created to aid in understanding the data. These included the Elbow Method plot to determine the optimal number of clusters for KMeans, and scatter plots to visualize the resulting clusters. These visualizations not only provided clarity on the data structure but also helped in communicating our findings effectively.

In summary, the "Public Transport Traffic Data in France" dataset from Kaggle served as the backbone of our analysis, offering a detailed and comprehensive view of the public transportation system in France. The dataset's rich features and substantial size played a crucial role in enabling a deep and insightful exploration into the operational efficiencies of the train services.
